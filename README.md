# Python_Belt
Coding Dojo Timed Exam. 4.5 hours to complete this website from scratch.
This website was made with the Python/Django stack. 
Django's SQLite was used for the database, and Materialize was used for basic styling and responsive design.

This is a barebones social media type website. You can add quotes and like quotes by users. 
You can view users and upvote their quotes. 
You can add comments and delete only your comments. 
Additionally I provided validations for account creation and when editing your personal account.
